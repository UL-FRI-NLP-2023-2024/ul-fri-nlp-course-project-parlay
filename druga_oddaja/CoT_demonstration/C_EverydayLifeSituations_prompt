Create an NLI premise, one contradicting one entailing, and one neutral sentence and their labels.
Then make the premise and hypotheses 5-6 sentences (not less).
So this way we will have an NLI dataset with not sentences but paragraphs (both hypothesis and premise).
That way there will be a common premise and 3 separate hypothesis paragraphs with explanations of their relation to the premise.
Neutral should be something that does is not made more or less likely because of the premise.
Let the premise be a situation from everyday life and to get entailment and contradiction paragraph, common sense reasoning (what a common person in the same situation would do) should be applied or denied (in case of contradiction).
Be careful about the neutral hypothesis. It should be something in the context but not really related to the main idea. In a way seems like relevant to premise but not in the core idea.
