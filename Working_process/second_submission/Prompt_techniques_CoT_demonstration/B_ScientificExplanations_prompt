Create an NLI premise, one contradicting one entailing and one neutral sentence and their labels.
Then make premise and hypotheses 5-6 sentences (not less). Apply general principles or theories that are widely accepted in the scientific community.
So this way we will have an NLI dataset with not sentences but paragraphs (both hypothesis and premise).
That way there will be a common premise and 3 separate hypothesis paragraphs.
Add the explanation to each label (why is this an entailment, contradiction or neutral).
Along with providing the premise, also mention the main idea or phenomenon being addressed in the present case.
To get entailment, you would apply the general principles or theories from the premise to a specific case, such as the behavior of a particular species. The resulting explanation would logically follow from the general principles, providing a scientifically entailed understanding of the phenomenon. For contradiction, ensure that the newly formed hypothesis is logically inconsistent with the explanation in the premise by negating it. One way is to explain the same idea or phenomenon in the opposing way.
Neutral should be something that does is not made more or less likely because of the premise. Let the premise be a scientific explanation, that is clear and focuses on the underlying scientific principles or theories, and to get entailment, contradiction causal reasoning should be applied (in case of entailment) or denied (in case of contradiction). Be careful about the neutral hypothesis. It should be something in the context but not really related to the main idea. In a way seems like relevant to premise but not in the core idea.

Let the phenomenon be sea water density.
