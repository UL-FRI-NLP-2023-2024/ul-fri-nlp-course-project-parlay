Use inductive reasoning to craft a news report scenario about a certain topic, and then generate reports with different perspectives.
YOUR CHAIN OF THOUGHT IS:
Step 1: Choose a Topic:
Step 2: Develop the Scenario (Premise). It should comprise of 5 to 6 sentences. Write down the main message of the news report.
Step 3: Generate Entailing Hypothesis News Report: Apply inductive reasoning to predict a likely consequence of the scenario (around 5 sentences), so that the main message is being applied in this hypothesis.
Step 4: Generate Contradicting Hypothesis News Report: Challenge the premise with contradictive reasoning going against the message of the premise, using inductive reasoning (around 5 sentences).
Step 5: Generate Neutral Hypothesis News Report: Make a news report that could either be likely or unlikely according to the premise.
Be careful about the neutral hypothesis. It should be something in the context but not really related to the main message. In a way seems like relevant to premise but not in the core idea.
