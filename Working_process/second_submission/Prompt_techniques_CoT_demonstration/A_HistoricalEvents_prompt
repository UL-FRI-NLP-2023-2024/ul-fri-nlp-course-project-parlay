I want to prepare a natural language inference dataset composed of a premise, hypothesis, and label.
The label must be entailment, contradiction, and neutral. But unlike regular natural language inference where they use sentences as premises and hypotheses, you will create a dataset whose premises and hypotheses are paragraphs composed of no less than 5 to 6 sentences.
Create just one new unseen example of premise and its according 3 hypotheses with their particular explanation. Learn from example 1 and example 2 below how to do it.
Your chain of thought for doing this task would be:
STEP 1 - Make a scenario paragraph (to set the context for the hypothesis in the next step). Ensure historical accuracy by choosing well-documented events. Frame the scenario paragraph neutrally and create effective historical scenarios that encourage applying either cause and effect, temporal reasoning, reasoning by analogy, counterfactual reasoning, or insights into motivations and perspectives, all this to allow for diverse reasoning paths based on the chosen hypothesis (entailment hypothesis, contradiction hypothesis, and neutral hypothesis).
STEP 2 - composition of the entailing hypothesis
STEP 3 - Write the path of reasoning why premises and hypothesis are in entailing (evolve the arguments, related to the particular scenario (premise) and hypothesis).
STEP 4 - composition of the contradictory hypothesis
STEP 5 - Write the path of reasoning why premises and hypothesis are in contradiction (evolve the arguments, related to the particular scenario (premise) and hypothesis).
STEP 6 - composition of the neutral hypothesis
STEP 7 - Write the path of reasoning why premises and hypothesis are in neutral relation (evolve the arguments, related to the particular scenario (premise) and hypothesis).
EXAMPLES:
[EXAMPLE 1.] ENTAILMENT LABEL {Scenario (premise): "In the middle of the 14th century, a dark bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, swept across Europe. This highly contagious disease, transmitted by fleas on infected rats, raged like wildfire across the continent, spreading death and devastation. In this atmosphere of immense suffering and fear, people sought explanations for this inexorable disaster. Underlying this were pre-existing religious tensions and social inequalities. In the search for scapegoats, these tensions flared up and turned against marginalised groups, with Jews in particular becoming the target of hatred and accusations. They were accused of poisoning wells and spreading disease. This false belief triggered a wave of violence and persecution. Jewish residents were driven from their homes, their property confiscated, and many were victims of pogroms and murder.",
Entailment hypothesis: "In 1692, the small Puritan town of Salem, Massachusetts, was convulsed by hysteria, leading to one of the most tragic chapters in American history - the Salem Witch Trials. A series of persecutions, property seizures, accusations, trials and executions for witchcraft were based on false accusations, fear and the religious fanaticism that prevailed in the community at the time. It all started with unexplained illnesses affecting some young girls in Salem. Underlying the social unrest and religious tensions, some saw these diseases as the work of witches.Women from all walks of life were accused, but they tended to be older, poor or otherwise different women who had been marginalised before.",
Particular explanation: "Although separated by time and space, these two historical events have the same intrinsic reasons.What both events have in common is the existence of pre-existing social tensions and stratification.Both events occurred against a backdrop of immense suffering and fear as societies faced relentless disasters - the bubonic plague and unexplained diseases.In this climate of uncertainty, people sought explanations and to find the culprit. In both cases, marginalised groups were targeted for persecution, in the 14th century by Jews and in Salem in 1692 by women, often elderly, poor or otherwise.Jews were accused of poisoning wells and spreading plague, while women in Salem were accused of witchcraft.The persecution was based on prejudice against people who were different and on religious fanaticism.False accusations led to violence, deportations and the murder of innocent people.",
Generalized explanation: "During periods of major health crises (plagues, unexplained illnesses), pre-existing social tensions, divisions and religious fanaticism are intensified. ', 'When faced with death and illness, people often experience intense fear and uncertainty, which can lead to When faced with death and illness, people often experience intense fear and uncertainty, which can lead to mistrust, paranoia and hatred of those who are different or marginalised.", "Unable to find explanations for suffering and misfortune, people may turn to simple and sometimes false explanations that blame marginalised groups. ", "In times of crisis, marginalised groups can be victims of false accusations, violence and persecution."},
CONTRADICTION LABEL {Scenario (premise): "In the middle of the 14th century, Europe was engulfed by the dark bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death.This highly contagious disease, transmitted by fleas on infected rats, raged like wildfire across the continent, wreaking death and devastation.In this atmosphere of immense suffering and fear, people sought explanations for this inexorable disaster.Underlying this were pre-existing religious tensions and social inequalities.In the search for scapegoats, these tensions flared up and turned against marginalised groups, with Jews in particular becoming the target of hatred and accusations.They were accused of poisoning wells and spreading disease.This false belief triggered a wave of violence and persecution.Jewish populations were expelled from their homes, their property confiscated and many were victims of pogroms and murder.",
Contradiction hypothesis: "The Ebola outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 was one of the worst outbreaks of this deadly disease in history. More than 28,000 deaths were recorded, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Although there were some misconceptions about the cause of Ebola at the beginning of the outbreak, over time, more scientific understandings have gained ground through public awareness efforts.The World Health Organisation and local health organisations have played a key role in disseminating accurate information on the mode of transmission and preventive measures.In West Africa, there were no significant existing social tensions associated with Ebola.Religious affiliation also played no role.This reduced the risk of scapegoating, and so there was no targeting of anger over the spread of the disease against particular groups.",
Particular explanation: "Although both Ebola and bubonic plague were devastating pandemics in West Africa, causing much suffering and death, people's response to the two diseases differed significantly.These differences were due to a variety of factors, such as different social contexts, different understandings of the disease in the 14th and 21st centuries, and scientific advances made over several centuries. Despite similar challenges of uncertainty, fear and distress, the Ebola case has not seen widespread blame-finding or blaming of certain marginalised groups for the spread of the disease."
Generalized explanation: "Two historical events may appear similar but have different internal causes and different social contexts.Such apparently similar but in fact different historical events do not lead to analogous social consequences."}
NEUTRAL LABEL {Scenario (premise): "In the middle of the 14th century, a dark bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, swept across Europe.This highly contagious disease, transmitted by fleas on infected rats, raged like wildfire across the continent, wreaking death and devastation.In this atmosphere of immense suffering and fear, people sought explanations for this inexorable disaster.Underlying this were pre-existing religious tensions and social inequalities.In the search for scapegoats, these tensions flared up and turned against marginalised groups, with Jews in particular becoming the target of hatred and accusations.They were accused of poisoning wells and spreading disease.This false belief triggered a wave of violence and persecution.Jewish populations were expelled from their homes, their property confiscated, and many were victims of pogroms and murder.",
Neutral hypothesis: "The Jewish community in 14th-century Europe was diverse, consisting of merchants, craftsmen, scholars, doctors and religious leaders. Their presence was important for the economy and culture of many European cities. They were quite different from the Christian population in their festivals, customs, culture and dress. Jews were often active in trade and finance, which brought them wealth and influence. However, this also led to envy among some of the Christian population.Their activities in the arts, music and literature made Jews a major contributor to the intellectual life of society, and they were important translators of scientific and philosophical works from Arabic and Hebrew into Latin.In many European countries, the professions and rights available to Jews were restricted and they were subject to special taxes.",
Particular explanation: "In 14th-century Europe, there was also a Jewish community that differed from the majority population in its religion and culture.",
Generalized explanation: "In 14th-century Europe, in addition to the majority Christian population, there were also members of other religions and cultures."}
[EXAMPLE 2] ENTAILMENT LABEL {Scenario (premise): "French society in the 18th century was divided into three estates: the nobility, the clergy and the third estate. The nobility and the clergy enjoyed privileges and wealth, while the third estate, which included the majority of the population, bore the greatest tax burden and had no political power. France experienced a series of economic crises in the 18th century, which affected the third estate in particular. Increases in food prices, unemployment and poverty caused great suffering and unrest among the population.The ideas of the Enlightenment, which emphasised liberty, equality and fraternity, spread more and more among the population. People rebelled against the absolutist monarchy and demanded change.The Revolution led to the overthrow of King Louis XVI, the establishment of the Republic and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.",
Entailment hypothesis: "The American colonies were divided between a wealthy elite of loyalists, allied to the British Crown, and a vast majority of the population, consisting of a third estate with no real political power and the greatest tax burden.This caused great discontent and resentment among the population, who felt exploited and oppressed. In the 18th century, the British colonies were heavily dependent on trade with Great Britain. However, the British Parliament passed a series of laws that restricted the colonies' freedom of trade and made it difficult for them to engage in economic activity, leading to inflation and deprivation among the population. Inspired by the idea of the Enlightenment, the people of the colonies began to demand greater freedom, equality and autonomy. In 1775, the colonists rebelled against British rule and launched the War of Independence. After the end of the Eight Years' War and the colonists' victory in 1783, the United States of America signed the Declaration of Independence and became a free and independent country.",
Particular explanation: "Both the French Revolution and the American War of Independence happened for similar internal reasons: social inequality, economic hardship and the influence of Enlightenment ideas. The French Revolution and the American War of Independence both led to the establishment of a republic based on the principles of liberty and equality. ",
Generalized explanation: "The end of the 18th century was a period of great social and political upheaval in Europe and America.", "During this time, many revolutions and wars took place that overthrew monarchies and established republics. "These revolutions were the result of a combination of factors of social inequality, economic hardship, and the desire for greater freedom, justice, and popular sovereignty that underpinned the idea of the Enlightenment."}
CONTRADICTION LABEL {Scenario (premise): "French society in the 18th century was divided into three estates: the nobility, the clergy and the third estate. The nobility and the clergy enjoyed privileges and wealth, while the third estate, which comprised the majority of the population, bore the greatest tax burden and had no political power. France experienced a series of economic crises in the 18th century, which affected the third estate in particular.

The Revolution led to the overthrow of King Louis XVI, the establishment of the Republic and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen",
Contradiction hypothesis: "The Bourbon Restoration was a period in French history that lasted from 1815 to 1830. It represented the return of the Bourbon monarchy to power after the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. This event marked a dramatic break with the French Revolution and its ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity. The new government adopted conservative policies that limited the freedoms achieved during the Revolution. This included restrictions on freedom of the press, religious freedom and political participation. The government also strengthened the power of the Church and the nobility, who had lost privileges during the revolution, while peasants and workers remained poor and without rights. The mass return of the nobility, forced into exile during the French Revolution, also had an impact on the art and culture of the time. Many artists and writers during this period focused on themes of nostalgia for the old order and criticism of the Revolution.",
Particular explanation: "The French Revolution and the Bourbon Restoration are mutually contradictory events in their origins, aims, internal reasons and social effects. The French Revolution was a radical social and political transformation that overthrew the monarchy and established a republic based on the ideas of liberty, equality and fraternity. The Restoration of the Bourbons, on the other hand, represented the return of the monarchy and thus the restoration of the old order before the Revolution. The main cause of the Revolution was the deep inequality between the Estates and the desire to change the social system. The people were fighting against an absolutist monarchy and oppression by the nobility and the clergy. The restoration of the Bourbon monarchy was not the result of popular revolt or a desire for change, but of the external influence of the victorious allies in the Napoleonic Wars. Their aim was to ensure the return of the old order and to prevent the spread of revolutionary ideas. The Revolution brought about the liberation of the third estate and the establishment of a more equal society, while the Bourbon Restoration consolidated the privileged position of the nobility and the clergy and pushed the third estate back into a position of subordination and exploitation.",
Generalized explanation: "The French Revolution and the Bourbon Restoration represent two opposite directions in French history.", "The Revolution was a struggle for freedom and equality, while the Bourbon Restoration was a restoration of the old order of inequality and oppression."}
NEUTRAL LABEL {Scenario": "French society in the 18th century was divided into three estates: the nobility, the clergy and the third estate. The nobility and the clergy enjoyed privileges and wealth, while the third estate, which included the majority of the population, bore the greatest tax burden and had no political power. France experienced a series of economic crises in the 18th century, which affected the third estate in particular. Increases in food prices, unemployment and poverty caused great suffering and unrest among the population.

The Revolution led to the overthrow of King Louis XVI, the establishment of the Republic and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen",
Neutral hypothesis: "The Enlightenment was marked by an emphasis on reason, freedom and progress. The Enlightenment criticised the feudal system and the privileges of the nobility and encouraged the rise of the middle class, which became an important force in society. The open spirit of the Enlightenment was reflected in all aspects of culture, including art, music, literature and architecture. In literature, novels, plays and essays were popular, dealing with themes such as human nature, social criticism and political philosophy. Important writers of the Enlightenment were Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Mary Wollstonecraft. Neoclassicism, inspired by ancient Greece and Rome, dominated the arts. Artists created paintings and sculptures with mythological and historical themes that emphasised the ideals of freedom, virtue and heroism.",
Particular explanation: "The scenario focuses on a specific historical event (the French Revolution) and its socio-political causes and consequences, while Paragraph B provides the broader context of the Enlightenment as a cultural and intellectual movement. The script emphasises the impact of the Enlightenment on social and political unrest, while the paragraph focuses on the intellectual and cultural aspects of the movement. The scenario (paragraph A) would be the premise for paragraph B if paragraph B focused on specific ideas of the Enlightenment and showed how these ideas influenced the French Revolution. Paragraph B would be a hypothesis for Scenario (paragraph A) if the specific events in 18th century France described in the scenario could be inferred from the general characteristics of the Enlightenment.",
Generalized explanation: "Scenario (paragraph A) and paragraph B are in a neutral relationship because they do not focus on the same aspects of the Enlightenment and do not offer direct conclusions between them.
