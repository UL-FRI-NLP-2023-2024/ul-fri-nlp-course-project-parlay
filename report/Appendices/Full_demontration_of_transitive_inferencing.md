# 4.3.1 DEMONSTRATION OF STRUCTURED PROMPTING AND TRANSITIVE INFERENCING

We will demonstrate the application of structured prompting and transitive reasoning in the context of an everyday life scenario and its corresponding entailment.

## 1. Scenario Premise Creation

### Initial Scenario Creation
**Objective:** To generate a scenario based on a clear main idea.

**Process:**
- **Identify the main idea:** The main idea is the core situation or phenomenon around which the scenario is built. In this case, the main idea is to organize a child’s birthday party with a promised ice cream bar and encounter a challenge.
- **Expansion:** Extend the main idea into a detailed narrative that provides a comprehensive context and details.
- **Generate the scenario:** Using the main idea, we prompt the model to create a scenario that captures the essence of the problem.

**Generated Scenario:**
> "It's a hot summer afternoon. You should get everything readily available before your child's birthday party starts in a few hours. The guest list is full of excited toddlers, and you promised a big ice cream bar as the main attraction. You arrive at the grocery store and plan to purchase various ice cream flavors, toppings, syrups, and whipped cream. As you reach the frozen food aisle, your stomach sinks. A large sign reads, 'Power Outage – Frozen Foods Not Available.' Panic starts to set in. How can you successfully host a party without the promised ice cream extravaganza?"

## 2. Entailment Hypothesis Creation
**Objective:** To create a hypothesis probability of which has increased because of a given scenario premise.

**Process:**
- **Identify key elements of the scenario:** Focus on the main problem (lack of ice cream) and the actions taken to address it (finding alternative ingredients).
- **Generate a hypothesis:** The hypothesis should directly follow from the scenario, showing a plausible outcome of the actions described.
- **Expansion:** Expand the main sentence about the parent’s challenge into a detailed narrative focusing on the parent’s efforts to find alternatives and ensure the party’s success despite the setback.

**Entailment Hypothesis:**
> "Since ice cream is urgently needed for the party, you decide to improvise. You head to the baking aisle and grab a pack of whipping cream and a box of your favorite chocolate cookies. You realize that with these ingredients and the milk you already have at home, you can make a homemade ice cream substitute. Although it won’t be exactly the same, it will still satisfy your need for ingredients to prepare an ice cream treat for the children’s party."

**Reasoning:** The hypothesis logically follows from the scenario. It describes a reasonable solution (improvising with alternative ingredients) to the problem (lack of store-bought ice cream), ensuring that the party is still successful despite the initial setback.

## Application of Transitive Reasoning
In this example, we apply transitive reasoning to connect the scenario with the entailment hypothesis through intermediate premises.

### Intermediate Premises:
- **Premise 1:** The parent needs ice cream for the party (main idea from the scenario).
- **Premise 2:** The store’s frozen food section is not available because of a power outage (complication introduced in the scenario).
- **Premise 3:** The parent decides to look for alternative ingredients (logical action based on the need to fulfill the promise).
- **Premise 4:** The parent finds whipping cream, chocolate cookies, and milk at home (specific alternatives found).
- **Premise 5:** These ingredients can be used to make a homemade ice cream substitute (feasibility of the solution).

### Deriving the Entailment: Connecting the Premises and the Conclusion
- Given that the promised ice cream is not available (Premise 1 + Premise 2), the parent should find a solution (Premise 3). The parent finds alternative ingredients (Premise 4). These ingredients can be used to make a substitute (Premise 5).
- **Conclusion:** The parent improvises to make a homemade ice cream substitute, thereby ensuring that the promised ice cream bar is delivered in some form. This action not only solves the immediate problem of lacking ice cream but also ensures that the party can proceed successfully with the planned main attraction.
