Descriptive Statistics:
Chat Outcomes:

Count: There are 10 data points in the Chat outcomes dataset.
Mean: The average total score for Chat outcomes is approximately 43.37.
Standard Deviation (std): The standard deviation of the total scores is approximately 2.88, indicating the spread of scores around the mean.
Min: The minimum total score observed in the Chat outcomes dataset is 39.17.
25th Percentile (Q1): 25% of the total scores fall below 42.29.
Median (50th Percentile or Q2): The median total score, which represents the middle value of the dataset when arranged in ascending order, is approximately 43.08.
75th Percentile (Q3): 75% of the total scores fall below 44.04.
Max: The maximum total score observed in the Chat outcomes dataset is 50.00.

Gemini Outcomes:

Count: There are 10 data points in the Gemini outcomes dataset.
Mean: The average total score for Gemini outcomes is approximately 41.33.
Standard Deviation (std): The standard deviation of the total scores is approximately 4.83, indicating a wider spread of scores compared to the Chat outcomes dataset.
Min: The minimum total score observed in the Gemini outcomes dataset is 32.01.
25th Percentile (Q1): 25% of the total scores fall below 38.92.
Median (50th Percentile or Q2): The median total score is approximately 42.01, which is slightly lower than the median for Chat outcomes.
75th Percentile (Q3): 75% of the total scores fall below 45.17.
Max: The maximum total score observed in the Gemini outcomes dataset is 47.00.
T-test Results:
t-statistic: The calculated t-statistic is approximately 1.14.
p-value: The p-value associated with the t-test is approximately 0.27.
Interpretation:
The t-statistic measures the difference in means between the two datasets relative to the variation within the datasets. A higher absolute t-statistic indicates a larger difference between the means.
The p-value indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis (that there is no difference between the means) were true. A smaller p-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
Conclusion:
With a p-value of 0.27, which is greater than the conventional significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean total scores between the Chat and Gemini outcomes datasets. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to claim that one system consistently outperforms the other based on these total scores.

The descriptive statistics show that the average total score for Chat outcomes is 43.37,
with a standard deviation of 2.88, while for Gemini outcomes, the average total score is 41.33 with a standard deviation of 4.83.
The t-test results indicate a t-statistic of 1.14 and a p-value of 0.27,
suggesting no significant difference in mean total scores between the two systems.
Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that one system consistently outperforms the other based on these scores.
